## Introduction

The Sentiment Analysis with Hugging Face Transformers and BERT project focuses on using advanced natural language processing techniques to analyze sentiment in text data. This guide is suitable for beginners and experienced practitioners interested in sentiment analysis and leveraging state-of-the-art models like BERT.

## Setup

To get started, you'll need to set up your environment and install the required dependencies. This includes installing Hugging Face Transformers and ensuring you have access to a pre-trained BERT model for sentiment analysis.

## Model Training

In this section, we cover how to train the sentiment analysis model using BERT. We provide step-by-step instructions on loading the pre-trained BERT model, fine-tuning it on your dataset, and evaluating its performance.

## Scraping Yelp Reviews

To scale up sentiment analysis and analyze sentiment on a larger scale, we demonstrate how to use BeautifulSoup to scrape reviews from Yelp. This allows you to collect a large corpus of text data for sentiment analysis.

## Sentiment Analysis

Finally, we showcase how to perform sentiment analysis on the scraped Yelp reviews using the trained BERT model. We walk you through the process of preprocessing the text data, applying the BERT model for sentiment classification, and interpreting the results.

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Download the pre-trained BERT model.
4. Ensure BeautifulSoup is installed for web scraping.

## Usage

Once everything is set up, you can start using the project for sentiment analysis. Follow the provided scripts and instructions to train the model, scrape Yelp reviews, and perform sentiment analysis on the collected data.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community. If you have suggestions, improvements, or bug fixes, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
